### Tools

- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Microsoft Excel
- Data analysis and visualization: Microsoft Excel


### Data Cleaning and Preparation  

The data was loaded into power query where data cleaning and prepartion was done:
  - Duplicates were removed
  - Year, month and day of the week were extracted from the date
  - The patients were grouped based on their age: Young (<40), Midddle age (40-64), Elderly (65>)

### Data Analysis 

The analysis done was in 3 main segmentation: 
1. Patients demographics (Gives details about the patients)
2. Medical conditions (Sumarrizes each medical condition)
3. Time progression (Highlights the time-related factors of the conditions)


The visualization was done using Microsoft Excel

### Key Insights

1. $1.28B was spent on the management of NCDs across ~40,000 health facilities
2. 37% of patients are middle-aged, and accounts for highest percentage of patients by age-group
3. Males incurred more NCDs management costs
4. While the greatest expenditure was for Diabetes management, Arthritis resulted in more patient admission
5. Emergency cases accounted for 32.8% of patient admission
6. 74.1% of patients were admitted during the weekdays.

### Recommendation 
#### INDIVIDUALS
1. Adopt Healthy Lifestyles for Prevention:
-Reduce consumption of processed foods, sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats.
-Engage in regular exercise

#### GOVERNMENT AND KEY HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS
1. Strengthen Primary Prevention and Health Promotion:
- Invest in Public Health Campaigns
- Create supportive environment 

2. Integrate and Modernize Healthcare Delivery:
- Significantly bolster Primary Health Care (PHC) facilities to focus on NCD screening, risk assessment, and long-term, non-emergency NCD management.

3. Enhance Data and Research Capacity:
- Ensure a functional NCD registry to track incidence, prevalence, mortality, and financial expenditure across all age groups and demographics.
- Research Key Insights from the registry to facilitate targeted policy interventions.
